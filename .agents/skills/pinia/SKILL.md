# Pinia

## In othra

- `ui/console` uses Pinia 4 through `@pinia/nuxt` in a Nuxt 4 SPA (`ssr: false`): no server state, no hydration.
- Write setup stores only: `defineStore('orgs', () => { ... })` with `ref`/`computed` and plain functions; one store per file in `app/stores/`.
- `defineStore`, `ref` and `computed` are auto-imported; stores, components and own composables are imported explicitly (`imports.scan: false`).
- Stores call the Connect clients from `useNuxtApp()` (`$orgClient` and friends) and expose `items`, `loading`, `loaded`, `error` plus actions such as `load()` and `ensureLoaded()`.
- Errors shown to users go through `useErrorMessage()`; ids held in state are public ids, never UUIDs.
- Test each store next to it (`orgs.test.ts`) with `setActivePinia(createPinia())` and mocked clients from `test/nuxt-globals.ts`; `@pinia/testing` is not installed.
- See docs/howto/console-page.md for how a console page, its store and its tests fit together.

Pinia is the official state management library for Vue, designed to be intuitive and type-safe. It supports Options API and setup (Composition API) stores, with first-class TypeScript support and devtools integration. othra uses setup stores.

## Key Recommendations

- **Use Setup Stores** (othra uses no option stores)
- **Use `storeToRefs()`** when destructuring state/getters to preserve reactivity
- **Actions can be destructured directly** - they're bound to the store
- **Call stores inside functions** not at module scope
- **Call every `useStore()` before the first `await`** in an action or setup function
- **Test stores directly** with a fresh `createPinia()` per test and mocked API clients
