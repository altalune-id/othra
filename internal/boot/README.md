# boot

`boot` is the composition root. It turns `config.Config` into a running app:
it opens the database, builds every domain service, wires the surfaces onto
them and starts the workers. No other package wires domains together.

Keep this file in step with the code. When a domain, surface or worker is
added or removed, update the diagrams and the tables below in the same commit.

## Boot order

`Boot` (`boot.go`) runs these steps in order. Any error stops the boot.

```

`App.Run` starts the supervisor (`serve`). `App.RunMCP` serves MCP over stdio
instead (`othra mcp`). `App.SetPassword` (`othra user set-password`) and
`App.AddMember` (`othra member add`) are operator actions, booted with the
install URL, scheduler and consumer off.
`BootRemote` (`remote.go`) is the CLI side: config, a logger and a Connect
client (`internal/apiclient`) to a running server, with no database.

## Request flow

Each surface goes through its own chain, then reaches the same domain
service. Every service writes through its own store.

```

- **Public ids:** every id on a surface (Connect, MCP, CLI, console calls, `/login`'s JSON, webhook bodies and headers) is the 21-character `public_id`; UUIDs never leave the server and slugs appear only in URL paths. Each `controlplane.go` turns an incoming public id into its id once, through the `publicIDs` adapter (`publicids.go`, passed as `controlplane.Services.Refs` and to the MCP tools), and maps every outgoing id back. A malformed or UUID-shaped id is refused by the request rules (`GEN004`, `invalid_format`) before any lookup; an unknown or another org's well-formed id answers the same not-found. Members are named by the user's public id; API keys have none and are named by their hint within the org. `publicid_integration_test.go` fails if any RPC answers with a UUID.
- **Reach:** after the permission check, each `controlplane.go` checks that the caller reaches the org, project or resource (`kernel/authz.Reach*`). Out of reach answers 404.
- **MCP:** tools are generated from the same Connect services, so MCP and `/api` share one handler per RPC.
- **Request validation:** requests are validated against their proto rules (`buf.validate`, shared rules in `api/othra/v1/rules.proto`) before handlers run, on `/api` and MCP. `Boot` builds one `controlplane.Validator` (`Services.Validator`); the `/api` interceptor runs it after authn, the permission check and the tenant, and every generated MCP tool runs it right after decoding its input. A refusal is `GEN004` with the first field in `meta` and every field in `violations` (field, reason, param), never the value. The rules check shape only; services still enforce every domain rule. Slugs (`othra.slug`) and the new password's length repeat the domain's limits so clients see them first; the domain still checks them, plus reserved slugs, uniqueness and the rest of the password policy. A permission check that depends on the request itself (the key kind on `CreateAPIKey`, org-wide webhook events, membership of the org a request names) runs in the handler, after validation, so a caller who lacks it and sends a malformed request sees which fields are malformed (the public request shape, no data) before the 403.
- **Credentials required:** `requireCredentials` (`http.go`) makes `/api` and `/mcp` answer 401 and the console redirect to `/login?return_to=…` (local) or send a Basic challenge (basic mode) when no credential is sent. `/login`, `/logout`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/install`, `/invite`, `/welcome`, `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/static`, `/healthz` and `/readyz` stay open. A request with no Principal reaches nothing (`kernel/authz`).
- **Security headers:** every response except `/mcp` gets `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (`web.NewServer`, `middleware.SecurityHeaders`); a handler may override one (token pages send `no-referrer`, the API docs page its own CSP). `/mcp` is left alone because MCP hosts frame its views. HSTS is not set by othra: set it at the TLS edge (Cloudflare, nginx).
- **Embedded assets:** the console (`/console`, `internal/web/console`) and the sign-in assets (`/static`, `internal/web/static.go`) are served from memory by `internal/web/assets`. Every file has a strong `ETag` (a hash of its bytes, computed once at startup) and `If-None-Match` answers `304`. Console files under `_nuxt/` have hashed names and get `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, except the build manifest `_nuxt/builds/latest.json` (`no-cache`); other console files and `/static` files get `public, max-age=3600`. `index.html`, also served for every client route, is rebased once per handler (base path, `apiUrl`, `appVersion`), sent `no-cache` with the `ETag` of the rebased bytes, and gzipped in memory once. `make ui` writes `.br` and `.gz` next to each text asset (`ui/scripts/compress.mts`); a request whose `Accept-Encoding` allows it gets brotli, else gzip, with `Vary: Accept-Encoding` and an `ETag` per encoding. A `Range` request or a client without `Accept-Encoding` gets the plain file, a `.br` or `.gz` name answers 404, and a directory falls back to `index.html` (console) or 404 (`/static`).
- **Permissions:** `internal/permission` is the one table of the permissions each RPC needs (all of them; a missing or empty entry is denied). `authz.AnyAuthenticated` admits any signed-in caller; `authz.PersonOnly` admits only a signed-in person (profile, password, sign out everywhere, leave org), so a key is refused before its request is validated. The `/api` interceptor reads it, and every generated MCP tool takes its RPC's entry (`permission.For` in `mcp.go`).
- **App-only tools:** a tool marked `app_only` carries `_meta.ui.visibility: ["app"]`, so a host that honours MCP Apps offers it to the MCP view, not the model; with `mcp.appsUI` off it is not registered at all. A drafted invite is sent only through one (`member_invite_confirm`) or the console; on a host that ignores the visibility the model can call it too.
- **MCP scopes:** `tools/list` and `tools/call` both check every one of the tool's permissions against those the caller holds (`mcpinternal.ScopesFromContext`). No Principal holds none.
- **stdio:** `othra mcp` runs as `session.System()`, an operator, never as "no Principal".
- **Who calls services directly:** any signed-in surface (Connect, MCP, a signed-in web page) calls the `controlplane` handlers, never a service, because the handlers hold the permission and reach checks; services check domain rules only. Only pre-sign-in pages (login, install, invite landing), operator commands that boot the `App`, and workers call services directly. `reach_integration_test.go` calls every RPC from another org, and with a key limited to another project of the same org (only `GetOrg`, `ListOrgs` and `ListProjects` answer; the list holds only what the key reaches).

Every domain follows the same file layout: `<domain>.go`, `errors.go`,
`ports.go`, `store.go` + `pg*.go`, `service.go`, then one file per surface
(`controlplane.go`, `cli.go`, `web.go`), with templ in `<domain>/views`.

`internal/cli` is only the CLI shell: the root command, flags, config, and the
URL, token, profile and session-file resolution. Each domain's command tree is
its `cli.go` (`NewCmd`). Domains never import `internal/cli`, `internal/boot`,
`internal/controlplane` or `internal/web` (only `internal/web/layout`); the CLI's
Connect client lives in `internal/apiclient`, which imports no domain.

## Service wiring

`buildServices` (`services.go`) builds each service once and passes it to
whoever needs it. An arrow means "depends on". Small adapters in `services.go`
(`projectIDs`, `projectOrgs`, `ownerRoles`, `refResolver`, `memberPeople`, `memberDirectory`,
`memberOrgs`) fit one service to another domain's port; `memberPeople` and `memberOrgs`
(name and slug) serve `invite` too. `publicIDs` (`publicids.go`) turns org, project, user and
resource (agent or webhook endpoint) public ids into ids and back for every surface handler.

**Unit of work:** a use case owns its transaction; stores never begin one. `buildServices` makes one
`db.NewTransactor(k.Pool)` and hands it to every service that writes more than one row (`org`,
`agent`, `org/member`, `org/invite`, `install`, `legal`, the password resets in `auth`). A store joins the transaction on `ctx`
(`db.Reader`, `db.Writer`, `db.InTx`) or runs alone; a nested `RunInTx` joins the outer one.
`kernel/db`'s guard test fails if any other package begins a transaction.

`org → project` is the after-create hook that adds the default project, in the org's unit of work:
if it fails, the org is not created. An agent's save and its `agent.created`/`agent.updated` event
commit together; a failed enqueue fails the request.
`member → …` (dotted) are the effects set by `memberEffects` after every service exists
(`apikey` already depends on `member`). A removal ends the person's sessions, revokes their
personal keys in that org and queues a notice; a role change queues a notice and, when it lowers
the role, ends their sessions; leaving revokes their personal keys. All of it runs in the
membership change's transaction. Notice links start at `publicBase(cfg.HTTP)` (also used for
the install URL). `member` gets `WithOperatorSupport(caps.OperatorOrgSupport)` (on in cloud,
off in selfhosted): staff (an operator who is a person) follow their role in orgs they belong
to, and manage other orgs with the admin permission set only when it is on (selfhosted refuses
them there). No one acts on or grants more permissions than they hold, so only owners touch
owners. The stdio System principal, basic auth and the CLI `App` keep full operator power.
`WithDirectory(memberDirectory{…})` lets `member add --org-id` find the user by email and the org by
its public id.
`auth.Service` also changes a person's own account for the console profile page: `ChangePassword` checks
the current password, sets the new one, ends every other session (the `/api` interceptor and the web
session middleware put the request's session id on `ctx`, `session.SIDFrom`) and queues a "your
password was changed" email, in one unit of work; `SignOutEverywhere` ends every session.
`auth.Resets` (`Services.Resets`) is password reset by email, wired only with local login. A request
answers the same for every email and queues a link only for a person with a password and no
unused link younger than two minutes (a new link replaces older unused ones); the link
(`/reset-password/{token}`, valid one hour, stored as a SHA-256) moves the reset's public id into a
signed cookie (`session.SignedCookie`) and leaves the URL. Setting the password is one unit of
work: the link is used by a conditional UPDATE, the password is set, every session of the person
ends and a "your password was changed" email is queued. The `WelcomeGate` skips `/forgot-password`
and `/reset-password`, so a token is never copied into `/welcome?return_to=…`.
`install → auth` and `legal → auth` exist only on the web side, wired in
`http.go`. `buildLegal` builds `Services.Legal`. With local login, `firstBoot` publishes the built-in
documents: each `updated` value is a version, stored once with its text in `legal_documents`
(a stored version whose text changed stops the boot). Every acceptance (install, join,
`/welcome`) appends a `terms_acceptances` row naming both versions, in the same transaction as
`users.terms_accepted_at`. The `WelcomeGate` asks again when a person accepted before the current
versions were first published. With `compliance.termsURL` or `compliance.privacyURL` set, nothing
is snapshotted and no history is kept (a known limit); the gate then uses
`compliance.termsUpdatedAt`, which may not be in the future.

## Postgres

`db.driver` (`postgres`, the default and only driver) is the feature: the stores, the outbox, the
mail queue and the sessions keep their tables there. `postgres.*` is the connection.

- **Config:** `postgres.dsn` (secret, required), `postgres.role` (`SET ROLE` on every new
  connection), `postgres.schema` (default `public`) and `postgres.tablePrefix` (both bootstrap: the
  stores and the templated migrations use them), the pool (`postgres.maxOpenConns`,
  `postgres.maxIdleConns`, `postgres.connMaxLifetime`, `postgres.connMaxIdleTime`), the connect
  retry (`postgres.connectTimeout` 5s, `postgres.connectBackoff` 250ms), `postgres.reader.*` (a
  replica; empty `postgres.reader.dsn` reads from the writer), `postgres.migrator.{dsn,role}` (the
  credential migrations run on; empty uses `postgres.dsn`) and `postgres.health.{interval,timeout}`
  (30s, 2s). `db.autoMigrate` (default true) migrates at start. Env: `OTHRA_POSTGRES_DSN`,
  `OTHRA_POSTGRES_MIGRATOR_DSN`, `OTHRA_DB_DRIVER`, `OTHRA_DB_AUTO_MIGRATE`, …
- **Connection:** the root package `pg` (`pg.Open`) opens a `*sql.DB` with the role, retries the
  ping with backoff within `postgres.connectTimeout`, and applies the pool. No error or log carries
  a password. `db.go` here maps `postgres.*` to one `pg.Config` for the writer and one for the
  reader, and builds `db.Pool{W, R}`; the reader aliases the writer when it has no DSN.
- **Migrations:** `migrate` opens `postgres.migrator.dsn` (or `postgres.dsn`) with
  `postgres.migrator.role` and runs every migration under the advisory lock
  `migrate:<postgres.tablePrefix>` (`pg.RunWithAdvisoryLock`), so concurrent instances migrate once.
- **Shutdown and readiness:** the kernel closes the pool on shutdown. The `db-health` worker
  (`pg.HealthMonitor`) pings the writer and a distinct reader every `postgres.health.interval`;
  while one does not answer, `/readyz` answers 503.

## Redis

othra has one Redis connection, `redis.*`, and opens it **only when a feature selects it**. Each
feature picks its driver in its own block; today only `rateLimit.driver: redis` does (with a rate
limit group on). With the default config othra never connects to Redis; a `redis.url` that no
feature uses is ignored with one INFO line.

- **Config:** `redis.url` (secret; `redis://[user:password@]host:port[/db]`, or `rediss://` for
  TLS), `redis.keyPrefix` (default `othra:`), `redis.maxConnections` (10),
  `redis.minIdleConnections` (0), `redis.maxIdleTime` (5m), `redis.connectTimeout` (5s),
  `redis.readTimeout` (3s), `redis.writeTimeout` (3s). Env: `OTHRA_REDIS_URL`,
  `OTHRA_REDIS_KEY_PREFIX`, … A feature on `redis` with no `redis.url`, or a URL that is not
  `redis://` or `rediss://`, is a config error. Single-node URLs only. Needs Redis 5 or newer
  (tested on 7): the rate-limit script reads `TIME` before it writes.
- **Connection:** the root package `redis` (`redis.Open`) parses the URL, sets the pool and
  timeouts, adds tracing (`redisotel`, without command text) and pings once within
  `redis.connectTimeout`. A Redis that can't be reached fails boot with
  `redis: cannot connect to <host> (redis.url): …`; no error carries the password. `redis.go` here
  only decides whether to open it (`RedisFeatures`), maps `redis.*` to `redis.Config`, registers the
  closer and the health check; `readiness.go` adds that check to `/readyz`. Drivers take the plain go-redis `redis.UniversalClient` and their key
  prefix. Every process that boots the `App` (server, workers, operator commands) gets it here;
  remote CLI commands never touch Redis.
- **Shutdown and readiness:** the kernel closes the connection on shutdown (and a failed boot
  closes it). The `redis-health` worker pings every 5 s; while Redis does not answer, `/readyz`
  answers 503. It never stops the process.
- **Key prefix (shared Redis):** every key starts with `redis.keyPrefix` (letters, digits and
  `. _ : -`, 1-64 characters; a trailing `:` is added), then a namespace per feature (`rl:` for
  rate limits, `cache:` later). On a Redis shared by several deployments or environments, give
  each its own prefix (`othra:prod:`, `othra:staging:`) or its own database number in the URL
  (`redis://host:6379/2`). Never share a prefix between deployments that should not share limits.
  othra never runs `FLUSHDB`, `KEYS` or `SCAN` over the instance.
- **Cache (later):** a cache gets its own `cache.*` block with `cache.store: memory | redis`,
  reuses this connection and puts its keys under `<prefix>cache:`.

## NATS

othra has one NATS connection, `nats.*`, and opens it **only when a feature selects it**. Today
only the queue does (`queue.enabled: true` with `queue.driver: nats`, the default driver). With the
default config othra never connects to NATS; a `nats.url` that no feature uses is ignored with one
INFO line.

- **Config:** `nats.url` (secret; `nats://[user:password@]host:4222`, several comma-separated, or
  `tls://`, `ws://`, `wss://`), `nats.user` and `nats.password` (secret, at least 16 characters) for
  one account, or `nats.token` (secret) for a server without accounts, not both; `nats.name` (the
  client name in NATS monitoring, default `othra`), `nats.connectTimeout` (10s). Env:
  `OTHRA_NATS_URL`, `OTHRA_NATS_USER`, `OTHRA_NATS_PASSWORD`, … The rules apply only while a
  feature uses NATS; then a missing `nats.url` or one that is not a NATS URL is a config error.
- **Connection:** the root package `nats` (`nats.Open`) dials until `nats.connectTimeout` (backoff
  250 ms to 2 s, 2 s per dial) and reconnects forever after that. Everything it reports goes to
  the app log, never stderr: each disconnect (WARN) and reconnect (INFO), asynchronous errors such
  as a slow consumer or a permissions violation (WARN, with the subject when there is one), and
  failed reconnect attempts (the first of an outage at WARN, the rest at DEBUG until it
  reconnects). A server that can't be reached fails boot with
  `nats: cannot connect to <host> (nats.url) …`; no error or log line carries the URL's
  credentials, the token or the password. `nats.go` here only decides whether to open it
  (`NATSFeatures`), maps `nats.*` to `nats.Config`, registers the draining closer and the health
  check. Drivers take the plain `*nats.Conn`.
- **Shutdown and readiness:** the kernel drains and closes the connection on shutdown (a failed
  boot closes it); the closer drains once, and a second `Close` returns the first result. The `nats-health` worker checks the connection every 5 s; while it is not
  connected (reconnecting or closed), `/readyz` answers 503. It never stops the process.
- **Shared server:** one NATS server can serve every app, with one account per app (the
  `OTHRA` account, user `othra`, as on `github.com/altalune-id/nats`). Accounts isolate apps,
  since every app uses the same stream names; never share an account between apps.

## Queue

`queue.enabled` (default false) turns the job queue on and `queue.driver` picks what carries it.
`Kernel.Queue` is the driver-agnostic `queue.Queue` (`internal/kernel/queue`: jobs, broadcasts,
handlers, listeners, `Declare`, `Submit`, `Emit`, `Consumer`, `Listener`); it imports no driver.
`buildQueue` (`queue.go`) picks the driver:

- **off:** `queue.Disabled`: Submit and Emit do nothing, and no consumer or listener runs.
- **`nats`** (the only driver): `internal/kernel/queue/nats` on the shared NATS connection. It
  creates the streams `WORK`, `DLQ` and `BROADCAST` (subjects `jobs.>`, `dlq.jobs.>`,
  `broadcast.>`) and one durable consumer per job. The names are the same in every Altalune app;
  the NATS account keeps apps apart.

A new driver is one more `case` in `buildQueue` and one more package under `internal/kernel/queue/`.
`Boot` builds the consumer (`k.Queue.Consumer`) unless the consumer is off, and the broadcast
listener (`k.Queue.Listener`, which starts at the stream's next message) whenever the queue is on.

othra's own rate limiter is **off by default**: many deployments limit at the edge (a CDN, nginx,
an API gateway). Each group has its own switch and all groups share one store. The only group now is
`auth` (`rateLimit.auth.enabled`). With every group off, no store and no janitor exist and every
group gets `ratelimit.Disabled()`, which allows every call.

- **Driver:** `rateLimit.driver` picks the store: `memory` (default, per server) or `redis` (shared by
  every server). The memory store runs GCRA over a map of at most
  `rateLimit.maxKeys` keys (default 100 000), and the `ratelimit.janitor` worker drops refilled
  keys every minute. When it is full, a new key first drops refilled keys (at most once a second),
  then is refused (429) if the store is still full, so a flood of unique IPs or emails can lock out
  new visitors until keys refill. Size `maxKeys` above the distinct IPs and emails you expect in 15
  minutes; each key costs roughly 100 bytes, so the default is about 10 MB. `rateLimit.maxKeys`
  applies to `memory` only.
- **Redis store:** `internal/kernel/ratelimit/redis` runs the same GCRA in one Lua script, so every server counts
  against one limit and gives the same answers as `memory`. Each key is
  `<redis.keyPrefix>rl:<rule>:<subject>` and holds the next allowed time in ms; it expires by itself
  once fully refilled (no janitor). Time comes from Redis `TIME`, so servers with drifting clocks
  still agree. It uses the shared connection (see Redis above); a Redis error or timeout fails closed
  (503), and `/readyz` reports not ready while Redis does not answer.
- **Per instance:** the memory store counts on one replica only. With several replicas, limit at the
  edge or use `driver: redis` to share the limits across servers.
- **Where (auth group):** `buildRoutes` hands one `auth.Limits` (the auth limiter and
  `http.trustedProxyHops`) to the login page and the invite pages. `POST /login` counts every attempt per
  client IP (60 per 15 minutes) and failed attempts per email hash (10 per 15 minutes, 5 at once; a
  success clears it). The invite link and page count 60 an hour per IP; invite join and accept, 20
  an hour per IP. A refused form answers 429 with `Retry-After` and a generic message (JSON
  `AUT003` for `/login` with `Accept: application/json`); a failing store answers 503 (fail
  closed). Known and unknown emails get the same answer, limiter on or off.
  `POST /forgot-password` counts 20 an hour per IP and 3 an hour per email; opening a reset link,
  its form and setting the password count 20 an hour per IP.
- **Client IP:** `layout.ClientIP` keys on `RemoteAddr`, or, when `http.trustedProxyHops` (env
  `OTHRA_HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`) is n >= 1, on the n-th `X-Forwarded-For` entry counted from the
  right. Each trusted proxy appends the address it saw, so entries further left are whatever the
  client sent. IPv6 is keyed by its /64. If the header has fewer than n entries, or that entry is
  not an IP, `RemoteAddr` is used, never an entry further left.
  - `0` (default): no proxy, othra faces the internet.
  - `1`: one proxy, e.g. Cloudflare only, or nginx only (`proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`).
  - `2`: two proxies, e.g. Cloudflare in front of nginx.

  **The origin must accept traffic only from the trusted proxies** (a firewall, or Cloudflare's
  IP ranges only); a client that reaches othra directly can write any `X-Forwarded-For` it likes.
  With the setting too low behind proxies, every client shares a proxy IP, so the per-IP limits
  (60 sign-ins per 15 minutes) apply to the whole site.

## Background workers

## Add a domain

1. Create `internal/<domain>` with the files above. Put its consumed interfaces in `ports.go`.
2. In `services.go`, add the store and service to `Services` and build them in `buildServices`.
3. For each surface it has:
   - **Connect:** `controlplane.Services` + `server.go`, and every RPC in `internal/permission`.
   - **CLI:** `<domain>/cli.go` (`NewCmd`), added in `internal/cli/root.go`.
   - **MCP:** `mcp.go`.
   - **Web:** `buildRoutes` in `http.go`.
   - **Readiness:** pass its check to `health.NewService` in `boot.go`.
4. Add a worker or scheduler job in `boot.go` / `schedulers.go` if it needs one.
5. Update this README: both diagrams, the domains table and the workers table.

The full checklists for this and every other kind of change are in [docs/howto](../../docs/howto/README.md), starting with [module](../../docs/howto/module.md).
