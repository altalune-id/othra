# schema

Postgres migrations for Othra, run by the app-agnostic `migrator` package
(goose). Files are templates: `{{.Schema}}`, `{{.TablePrefix}}`, `{{.Role}}`.
`Config.Schema` defaults to `public`; a non-empty `Config.Role` runs `SET ROLE`
on the migration connection.

Roles (`scripts/db/provision.sh`): migrations run as `othra_migrator` with
`SET ROLE othra_owner`, so `othra_owner` (NOLOGIN, BYPASSRLS) owns the schema,
every table, sequence and function, and `goose_db_version`. The app logs in as
`othra_service` (NOBYPASSRLS, no memberships, owns nothing), which gets
`SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on tables, `USAGE` on sequences and `EXECUTE`
on functions through the owner's default privileges, read-only access to
`goose_db_version`, and no `CREATE` or `TEMP`. Functions are never executable by
`PUBLIC`. `scripts/db/verify.template.sql` checks all of this. Integration tests
get the same split from `pgtest.MigratedRLS` (`othra_test_owner`,
`othra_test_service`).

Every foreign key to `orgs`, `projects`, `api_keys`, `webhook_endpoints` and
`users` cascades on delete, except `orgs.created_by`, `api_keys.created_by`,
`invites.invited_by` and `invites.accepted_by`, which are set to NULL.

## External migrations

Run another tool's migrations after ours on the same DB:

```go
schema.New(cfg).WithUpgrade("whatsmeow", meow.Upgrade).Up(ctx, db)
```

The external tool owns its tables under a reserved prefix; ours must not use it.
`MigrationsFS()` exposes the raw SQL for a guard test.

## Add a migration

1. `NNN_<name>.sql` at the next number, with a working `Down`.
2. Bump `VERSION`.
3. Add or update the `schema/entity` binding for the table.
4. In the same commit, update this README: the diagram (tables, columns,
   relationships) and the constraints table (new unique, check, partial or
   foreign-key rules).
