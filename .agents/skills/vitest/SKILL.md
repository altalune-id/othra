description: Vitest 5 unit testing for Othra's ui/* packages. Use when writing or fixing a *.test.ts next to a console store, composable, component helper or lib file, mocking a Connect client or Nuxt global with vi, raising coverage to meet the ui/console thresholds, or editing a vitest.config.ts or the shared @othra/vitest-config presets.

# Vitest

## In Othra

- Vitest 5 and `@vitest/coverage-v8` come from the workspace `catalog:`; every package extends a preset from `ui/vitest-config` (`node` for pure TS, `browser` for happy-dom).
- `globals: false`: import `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`, `beforeEach` from `'vitest'` in every file.
- Write `it(...)` inside a `describe(...)` block, as the existing tests do; do not switch to top-level `test(...)`.
- Tests sit next to the code (`app/stores/orgs.test.ts`); `ui/base/test/nuxt-globals.ts` (imported as `#test/nuxt-globals`) stands in for Nuxt auto-imports and Connect clients (`setClient`, `connectError`).
- `ui/console` runs `vitest run --coverage` with thresholds (lines/statements/functions 90, branches 85); a drop below fails the run.
- Store tests call `setActivePinia(createPinia())` in `beforeEach` (see the pinia skill).
- Fixture ids are public ids, never UUIDs. Run all UI tests with `pnpm ui:test`. See docs/howto/console-page.md.


Vitest is a next-generation testing framework powered by Vite. It provides a Jest-compatible API with native ESM, TypeScript, and JSX support out of the box. Vitest shares the same config, transformers, resolvers, and plugins with your Vite app.

**Key Features:**
- Vite-native: Uses Vite's transformation pipeline for fast HMR-like test updates
- Jest-compatible: Drop-in replacement for most Jest test suites
- Smart watch mode: Only reruns affected tests based on module graph
- Native ESM, TypeScript, JSX support without configuration
- Multi-threaded workers for parallel test execution
- Built-in coverage via V8 or Istanbul
- Snapshot testing, mocking, and spy utilities
